## Participatory

My goal was to create a PostGIS demo which would be accessible to students
if they have not installed Python, PostgreSQL, or PostGIS, and even if I
end up running the workshop without an internet connection:

- SQL queries and Python scripts for interacting with local PostGIS
- Basic server config for a read-only PostGIS in the cloud
- (ideally forkable) Python notebooks for PostGIS in the cloud

## Topics

- Finding and downloading geodata (govt data, OpenStreetMap)
- Setting up PostGIS
- SQL Review and Added Features of PostGIS
- Importing CSVs and geodata into PostGIS
- Python scripts for PostGIS
- Sample queries with map frontends: point-in-polygon, nearest point, buffers, statistics, etc
